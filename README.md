# MakeMySQLRemote



Just a friendly tool to do all the things to open up MySQL for remote access
and prompt you to create a remote user from the command line.
Mainly just tested on Ubuntu versions on Digital Ocean 

This has been a private GIST for a long time, but I figure I'll open it up as it's been very useful over the years, when I wanted to quickly open up MySQL for remote management using tools such as:
Navicat
Datagrip
Dbeaver
HeidiSQL
etc.
